Meetup 2 was held on 19th March at Plugin@Blk71, and saw James Tan from MongoDB, and Khang Toh from Picocandy coming down to speak about MongoDB in production.

This being the first meetup at Plugin, a hotbed for startups in Singapore, saw a fair bit of people who had never use mongo before, and a couple who had only use mongo in toy apps before. As a result, James spent more time covering on the basics of MongoDB, and how a production system should look like.  


After James&#8217; talk, we went outside for pizza, which was kindly sponsored by MongoDB, and started mingling around with one another. After pizzas, we went back in to continue with Khang&#8217;s talk.

Khang gave a short talk about how he built a scalable resumable file upload server using Tus.io and MongoDB, which in my opinion, was a rather interesting way to handle this problem in a scalable way. His slides can be found below.

The next meetup will be held at HackerspaceSG once again, and please do join us at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mongosg/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/groups/mongosg/</a> for more updates.
