I recently got myself a smart watch, a Weloop Tommy from China, which seems like a really good Pebble clone for less than half the price. Before going into the features, let&#8217;s get some photos first.

<a href="/images/2014/09/IMG_2055.jpg" rel="facebox" rel="attachment wp-att-2971"><img src="/images/2014/09/IMG_2055-300x200.jpg" alt="IMG_2055" width="300" height="200" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2971" /></a>

<a href="/images/2014/09/IMG_2054.jpg" rel="facebox" rel="attachment wp-att-2972"><img src="/images/2014/09/IMG_2054-300x200.jpg" alt="IMG_2054" width="300" height="200" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2972" /></a>

So I&#8217;ve been wearing the watch for 3 entire days at this point, started off fully charged, as I had charged it to 100% and left it on the charger for another hour, and the battery is currently at 72%. Have had a decent amount of notifications coming in, which could be part of the reason the battery is going down so fast, but the other possible reason is that the chip is still calibrating the battery. And given that at this point it is expected to take at least another 7 days to drain all the battery, I doubt I can get an accurate picture of the battery life anytime soon. Which I believe is a good thing given that most smart watches these days have batteries that last less than 1 week.

So as of now, the Android app has 3 main features, the camera feature, notification forwarding feature, as well as firmware update feature. The WeLoop team is saying that they will have more features such as watchfaces in around 1 month&#8217;s time as from this tweet below.

While the current Android app doesn&#8217;t have a wealth of features, it is enough to do most of the stuff I want it to, although I would definitely like to have the fitness feature and additional watchfaces really soon.

As for the watch itself, I seem to find that while the software is relatively stable, there are times when it crashes, and removes all the data inside, which is basically all your fitness data. In my 3 days wearing it, it has crashed 2 times. The silver lining though is that even though it crashes, it doesn&#8217;t brick the watch, and you don&#8217;t have to wait for the battery to run out(that would be a nightmare) before you can reset it.

As of now, the watch allows you to take photos with your phone, and it does this really neat thing where when you switch to the camera interface on the WeLoop app on the phone, you get the camera controls on the watch. The watch also has a fitness tracker that basically tracks the number of steps you have taken, as well as distance. I did some (non-scientific) experiments with this, and the data seems to come within 10m of what google maps gives me for a 380m distance. On top of that, the watch is also able to control your music player at this point, so you can play/pause music, as well as skip to the next track as well as go to the previous track too.

While this set of current features might not seem to be alot, it&#8217;s actually pretty decent, and enough for most daily uses. Looking forward to when they update the app and firmware, and will post more updates then.

[Update 1]  
The first battery run took 10 days to deplete, with every single function on, constantly connected to the phone.

[Update 2]
At this point, the battery is draining around 3% a day. If this goes on, it could easily reach 1 entire month without charging.
